       "   'review': \"Listen up Choom,\\n\\nI don't want to cause static, but did those gonk corpos push the release of the game before it was ready? Yeah, probably. Did they want our scratch? Yeah, definitely. Did they flatline the game? Almost. If it wasn't for the love and dedication of the developers of CD PROJEKT RED (and yeah, they might be corpos), then the vidiot would definitely be zeroed.\\n\\nThere were a lot of kickers who had issues upon release that stirred up a lot of heat. And yeah, there were some issues, but when you can just hide behind a handle and spam away on the net without a care in the world, the complaints stacked up and didn't give the vidiot its due justice. When you want to create the best, there is some gonks out there who will tear you down.\\n\\nSure, there were a few netrunners too who threatened the corpos, but little good that did them. Didn't slow down the developers. They kept pouring time and energy into the game. Fixin' it up and making it flash.\\n\\nThe developers broke their corpo leash and kept giving to us. Listening to the us chooms instead of those NetNerds who squat their mom's basements. That is why I nominated Cyberpunk 2077 for the Labor of Love in the 2022 Steam Awards. The developers care. A lot. And they continue to prove it by releasing new content, fixes, and polishin' the vidiot like a diamond.\\n\\nBottom line choom; when you need that escape from deep reality, you can get your fix with Cyberpunk 2077. \\n\\nIs it worth the eddies? You betcha it is.\\n\\nAlso, if you haven't eyeballed it yet, go check out the vidflick Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.\\n\\nGood hunting, choom.\",\n",

Johnny’s confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in. Cyberpunk 2077 setting is a hyper capitalist future in which megacorporations long ago exceeded the governments' ability to contain them. Nothing is off the table; everything is commodifiable.\\n\\n--{Graphics}---\\n☑ You forget what reality is\\n☐ Beautiful\\n☐ Good\\n☐ Decent\\n☐ Bad\\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\\n☐ Paint.exe\\n\\nDowntown Night City is soaked in 80s retrofuturism of neon and polyester. By contrast, the world of the rich and of megacorps is cold, shiny, and minimalist. The attention to detail is jaw dropping. One highlight is a corporate parade, when V makes their way through chattering crowds while holographic dragons float through the air between high-rise apartment complexes. Cyberpunk 2077 is the best-looking game released to date.  \\n\\n---{Gameplay}--- \\n☑ Very good\\n☐ Good\\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\\n☐ Mehh\\n☐ Starring at walls is better\\n☐ Just don‘t\\n\\nYou invest points into five primary attributes, and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. What’s great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into. I loved the gunplay; first-person animations are flashy and exciting.\\n\\n---{Audio}---\\n☐ Eargasm\\n☑ Very good\\n☐ Good\\n☐ Not too bad\\n☐ Bad\\n☐ Earrape\\n\\nThe music is impressive throughout, with radio stations full of custom songs by artists singing about the struggles of Night City, but the combat music stands out the best.\\n\\n---{Audience}---\\n☐ Kids\\n☐ Teens\\n☑ Adults\\n\\nDildos…. they’re just everywhere.\\n\\n---{PC Requirements}---\\n☐ MineSweeper comparable\\n☐ Potato\\n☐ Decent\\n☐ Fast\\n☑ Very Fast\\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\\n\\nSteady frame rate with very little stutters, only FPS drops are in densely populated areas. \\n\\n• AMD Ryzan 5800X3D\\n• Founders Edition 3080TI \\n• 16GB Corsair dominator platinum DDR4\\n• Asus TUF 570\\n• Windows 10 64 bit\\n• Resolution 3440 x 1440 – 21:9\\n\\n---{Difficulity}---\\n☐ Just press A\\n☐ Easy\\n☑ Significant brain usage\\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\\n☐ Difficult\\n☐ Dark Souls\\n\\n---{Grind}---\\n☑ Nothing to grind\\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\\n☐ Isn’t necessary to progress\\n☐ Average grind level\\n☐ Too much grind\\n☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding\\n\\n---{Game Time}---\\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\\n☐ Short\\n☐ Average\\n☑ Long\\n☐ To infinity and beyond\\n\\nOnce past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the sprawling map that is Night City. There is plenty of side quests available early on so these will keep you busy for a long time.\\n\\n---{Price}---\\n☐ It’s free!\\n☑ Worth the price\\n☐ If you have some spare money left\\n☐ Not recommended\\n☐ You could also just burn your money \\n\\n---{Bugs}---\\n☑ Never had any\\n☐ Minor bugs\\n☐ Can get annoying\\n☐ Made by Bethesda\\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\\n\\nCyberpunk 2077 was nothing short of a disaster a launch, plagued by bugs and consistent crashing; this was clearly an unfinished game. CD Projekt Red spent a good 18 months or so improving and adding to Cyberpunk 2077, fixing all the issues that were present at launch.\\n\\n---{Ultrawide Support}---\\n☑ Full support\\n☐ Can play in 21:9 but needs some tweaking\\n☐ No support at all\\n\\n---{9/10}---\\nCyberpunk 2077 was eagerly anticipated in 2020, once released gamers felt incredibly let down as the game was clearly not finished. After numerous patches the game feels like it's more of a completed product, but the damage has already been done to CD Projekt Red's reputation. While it still falls short when measured against the immense expectations that surrounded its release, Cyberpunk 2077 still hits most of its initial targets. The main story's a thrill ride, the combat is fantastic, and Night City is an incredible open world setting.\\n\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This game's a pretty good example of a love/hate relationship... People will either dislike it, just for the sake of the poor launch and other things that could've been done better, or will fall in love.\\n\\nI personally fell in love all the way. I've always been a fan of cyberpunk/future dystopia concept or art, so this game pretty much hit the sweet spot for me.\\nYes, there are still some issues, bugs and glitches in the game, several things that could've been done better and properly, the game's also missing some mandatory features as standard such as for instance vehicle customizations or access to different kinds of transport, etc... Simply things that would make this game even more GTA-ish, if this game is supposed to be the rival for GTA.\\n\\nBut what this game is mainly all about and what I love about it, is the atmosphere it produces, the emotions, the story, the characters and their individual stories, the dialogues, the neon world, the music and much more. This game makes you feel things. It dragges you into this world in a beautiful and sinful way. The size and depth of this game is also great, I've played many hours in this game and still feel like I barely explored the half of it. The music and soundtrack in this game is one of the best I've listened to, if not the best - fits the game perfectly and highlights all the emotions and atmosphere.\\n\\nIf you're a fan of this world like me, you're gonna forgive the game all the issues and mistakes and just will have a blast.\\n\\nHave a good day & have fun chooms!\",\n",

       "   'review': 'When this game launched, it was, for all intents and purposes, a broken mess. I beat the main quest line twice on two separate characters while the game was in that state, but I would not have recommended it to anybody else. It was a chore at times and downright unplayable at others, but the writing and characters were enough to make me fight through. \\n\\nIt\\'s a brilliant, poignant story, moving at times, frustrating at others, and constantly asking thought-provoking questions. Everything is held together by stellar performances from the voice cast, breathing life into real, fleshed-out characters that you connect with over the course of your playthrough. This game is also totally fine with you missing major plot arcs that are hidden in side quests that seem, at first, to be low-stakes optional content. Like The Witcher 3 before it, side quests are just as robust as the main quest. Explore and be rewarded.\\n\\nThe game has been patched to the point where, now, today, it is, for all intents and purposes, a polished release. I have beaten the main quest line four times since patch 1.3 and I would now recommend this game to anybody that likes good video games. The core ideas were phenomenal from the start, but now they actually work.\\n\\nYou might approach combat by hacking a group of enemies to disable their weapons without them noticing, sniping their netrunner (hacker) from afar to prevent a digital counter-attack, then beating them into dust while their guns explode in their hands as they attempt to shoot at you. Or you might decide to throw several recon grenades into an area to locate all the enemies, then follow up with laser-trap grenades for the heavily-armored enemies and incendiary and gas grenades for the lighter fodder, falling back on your smart submachine gun with homing rounds in case any faster enemies push your location. Or you could be like David from the anime, activating your Sandevistan and cutting your enemies to pieces while they stand almost motionless, watching their bodies hit the floor in unison when you\\'re finished.\\n\\nThe game has been \"good\" since release, but the number of weapons that will disappear from your inventory/cars that will fly through the air/enemies that will hide inside a wall and kill you from a mile away/quest-breaking bugs that will brick your save have been cut down to 0...except for the cars, you may spot some cars swimming on land. Don\\'t be afraid. They won\\'t seek you out and kill you like before.\\n\\n9/10 \\nMaybe next time make Johnny Silverhand a real-life AI to achieve total immersion.',\n",

       "   'review': \"Due to the hubbub over how buggy this game was when it released, I ended up holding off on buying it for a good while. Now nearly two years after it came out I've finished up with it and... it was worth it. Similarly to CDPR's last major game Witcher 3, this is easily one of the best open world RPG's i've played. The main story is plenty interesting enough, but all the side content - even tiny quick missions that in most games only fill the space - really help flesh out the world. The consensus? Night City is f*cked up and a pretty ugly place to live... but a great setting for a game. \\n\\nI did still have a few crashes, but my PC by now is seriously aging so maybe you won't have the same problems... maybe. At least the game autosaves often enough that the crashes didn't affect things much. Compared to how broken people made this game out to be at launch? It was perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nAnyway... I'm keeping this review short because I don't wish to spoil anything. This is the sort of game you really ought to experience for yourself. It is worth it. :D\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Ok, the launch version was bad, I totally agree. Bugs were everywhere, ports were incredibly bad, gameplay was impossible because you couldn't play the game and more. But, despite all of these set-backs and negativity, CDPR didn't just leave the game like that. Basically they didn't do a Bethesda, leave the game to modders and others to fix. They did a Hello Games, they received our messages and our cries and they went to work. Is the game in a playable state now? You bet your bottom dollar it is! All the elements of the gameplay, hacking, dashing, shooting, talking and more, are working how they supposed to be. Moreover, I can't even tell you how good the story is, you just have to play yourself to find out. Although there are still a handful of bugs left, the game is finally playable and fun to do so. Now the final question is, is the game providing everything it promised before the launch? Well, unfortunately no. Or at least not yet. Even though we still can't shoot while we drive, CDPR recently announced that they are adding it to the game with the next big patch. So, even if Cyberpunk 2077  doesn't have everything it promised now, they are on the way. Due to this, I still don't understand why people are having hard time to come back to this game. It's been 2 or 3 years since what happened, just put your worries to rest and give it another chance. I promise you won't leave disappointed, because I didn't. Even though I was expecting to. Thank you CDPR, and keep up the good work.\",\n",
